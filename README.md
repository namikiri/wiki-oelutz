# Wiki Oel√ºtz!
A lightweight and a bit strange Wiki engine for some old memetic video series. Code was written in far-far 2012 and abandoned for now. 

## Disclaimer
The code is insane as hell. It also has Russian explicit speech. It won't be removed because it is a part of that meme videos that impressed me to make this website. I'm so sorry (actually not).
